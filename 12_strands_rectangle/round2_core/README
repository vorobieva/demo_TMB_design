First round of combinatorial sequence design of the residues facing the pore. 

Selection of the energy function is done by running the design XML with the score weights provided in test/ on one representative input. Analyze the results using the sequence_stats.ipynb JUpyter notebook. 

For each input model, generate 10 ouputs by running the following command: 
cd $LINE && /software/rosetta/latest/bin/rosetta_scripts -s ../$LINE.pdb -parser:protocol ../design_core_all.xml -nstruct 5 > stdout.txt
Where $LINE is the name of the input model.

The input cst and core.resfile files should be customized for each input (an example is given here).

Rosetta version used to generate the published designs:

Analyze the output using the select_best_motif.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
