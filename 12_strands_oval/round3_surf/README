Second round of combinatorial sequence design of the lipid-exposed surface. 

To select an energy function, run the design XML script with all scoring weights provided in test/ on a representative model. Analyze the results with the sequence_stats.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

For each input, generate 10 models using the following Rosetta command:
cd $LINE && /software/rosetta/latest/bin/rosetta_scripts -s ../$LINE.pdb -parser:protocol ../design.xml -nstruct 10 > stdout.txt
where $LINE is the name of the input model. 

Analyze the output by select the stable mortise-tenon motifs after side-chain repacking using the analyze_round3_surf.py script and analyse_round3_surf.ipynb Jupyter notebook. 

Rosetta version used to generate the pubmished designs:
