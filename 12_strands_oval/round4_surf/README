Third round of combinatorial sequence design of the lipid-exposed surface, focusing on fine-tuning the hydrophobicity of the surface with Phe and beta-branched amino acids. 

To select an energy function fine-tuned for the blueprint, run the design XML script with all the scoring weights provided in test/ on a representative model. Analyze the output using the sequence_stats.ipynb Jupyter notebook. 

Prepare model-specific resfiles (fixes the Ser, Gly and Thr amino acids previously designed on the lipid-exposed surface) use the prepare_resiles.py script. 

For each input, generate 10 models using the following Rosetta command:
cd $LINE && /software/rosetta/latest/bin/rosetta_scripts -s ../$LINE.pdb -parser:protocol ../design.xml -nstruct 10 > stdout.txt
where $LINE is the name of the input model. 

Analyze the output by select the stable mortise-tenon motifs after side-chain repacking using the analyse_round4.ipynb Jupyter notebook. 

Rosetta version used to generate the pubmished designs:
